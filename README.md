# What to do if your done with git

You will find 3 files in this repository

- LICENSE
- members.txt
- README.md

You are requested to fork this repository and edit the **_members.txt_** file by adding your name, email and Github username in there (_You will find my name already in there, so just follow the similar format_)

After making suitable changes, create a push request and your changes will be reflected in the remote repository after approval.

After that you will be provided with the repository you will be working for the next year.

# Important naming and working convention

- Repo is short for repositories

- If you have watched tutorials regaring git before October 1 2020, you would have noticed the word _master_ used for the top branch, but instead of _master_ , branch _main_ is used as the top and starting of the hierarchical tree. Members are requested to keep this change in mind.

- The branch structure while working and implementing new features will be as followed
  main -> dev -> "name"/"feature" (**_Insert your own name and feature name_**)

- Use appropriate commit message explaining the featurs and changes made.

- Put your own name and email while editing _git config --global --edit_ (*run this command in your teriminal to save configs*)
